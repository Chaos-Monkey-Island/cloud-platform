# Delete a cluster

To delete a cluster you must first export the following:

```
$ export AWS_PROFILE=moj-cp
$ export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://cloud-platform-kops-state
```

Start from the root directory of a working copy of the [infrastructure repo].

First, set the kubectl context for the cluster you are deleting. The easiest way to do this is with kops. e.g:

```
$ kops export kubecfg david-test1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

You should see this output:

```
kops has set your kubectl context to david-test1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

Then, from the components directory, run these commands to destroy all cluster components, and delete the terraform workspace.

```
$ cd terraform/cloud-platform-components
$ terraform init
$ terraform workspace select <clusterName e.g. cloud-platform-test-3>
$ terraform destroy
$ terraform workspace select default
$ terraform workspace delete <clusterName>
```

Then run the following `kops` command (this will not delete the cluster).

Append it with `--yes` to confirm deletion.

```
$ kops delete cluster --name <clusterName>.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

Change directories and perform the following to destroy the cluster essentials, and delete the terraform workspace.

```
$ cd ../cloud-platform
$ terraform init
$ terraform workspace select <clusterName e.g. cloud-platform-test-3>
$ terraform destroy
$ terraform workspace select default
$ terraform workspace delete <clusterName>
```
