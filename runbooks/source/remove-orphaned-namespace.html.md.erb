# Remove 'orphaned' namespaces and AWS resources

Cluster namespaces, and the AWS resources associated with them, should be removed automatically by the build pipeline.

Sometimes this process doesn't work correctly, and we end up with 'orphaned' namespaces in the cluster. i.e. namespaces which exist in the kubernetes cluster but which have no associated source code in the [environments repo].

You can remove these namespaces, and their AWS resources, using the [environments checker].

### 1. `git clone` the [environments checker] repository

### 2. Create a `.env.live1` file, containing the environment variables the checker requires

The repository contains an `example.env.live-1` file. Copy this to `.env.live1` and replace the placeholders with real AWS credentials.

### 3. Do a dry run of deleting the target namespace

```bash
. .env.live1; make delete-namespace NAMESPACE=[orphaned namespace name]
```

This will run a `terraform plan` showing the resources that the script is going to delete.

### 4. Delete the AWS resources and the cluster namespace

```bash
. .env.live1; make delete-namespace NAMESPACE=[orphaned namespace name] DESTROY=destroy
```

This will actually delete the AWS resources and the namespace itself.
