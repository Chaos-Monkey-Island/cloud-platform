There is a [lambda function] in place which runs weekly and revokes public access for all our S3 Buckets. If we want grant public access to S3 buckets they must be [added as exceptions within module definion] followed by `terraform apply`.

NOTE: If we create s3 bucket as private and try to change to public later, terraform apply is failing with `Error: Error putting S3 ACL: AccessDenied: Access Denied`.
Running `terraform apply` again will say no changes to make, but you will notice that the bucket is not changed to public. There is an open [terraform issue] related to this error.
