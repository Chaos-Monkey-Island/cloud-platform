In the [build pipeline], you will sometimes see errors like this:

```
Command: cd namespaces/live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/jason-lab/resources; terraform apply -auto-approve failed.

Error: Error locking state: Error acquiring the state lock: ConditionalCheckFailedException: The conditional request failed
    status code: 400, request id: 8F9C5H04HLD0TVN4V0PQIRRMFBVV4KQNSO5AEMVJF66Q9ASUAAJG
```

If you see repeated failures trying to acquire the lock on the same namespace,
it probably means the lock record has been left in place by mistake, because a
previous run failed to release the lock when it should have.

To fix this, you need to delete the lock record.

1. Go to the [dynamodb] page of the AWS web console (NB: the relevant table is in the `eu-west-1` region)
2. Click on the [cloud-platform-environments-terraform-lock] table, and then the `Items` tab
3. Click `Add filter`
4. Enter `LockID` as the filter attribute, and change `String, =` to `String, contains` as the filter criteria
5. Enter the namespace name as the string value to match, and click `Start search`

When you find the relevant lock records, delete them. Terraform will recreate
any missing records the next time it tries to acquire the lock for that
terraform state file.
