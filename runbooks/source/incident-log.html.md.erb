# Incident Log

## February 2020

### Incident on 18-02-2020 14:13 UTC

- **Status**: Resolved at 14:59 UTC

- **Incident**: Pingdom reported that Prometheus was down (prometheus.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk).

- **Impact**: 
    - The prometheus dashboard was unavailable for everyone, for the whole duration of the incident.
    - Between 14:22 and 14:26, prometheus could not receive metrics.

- **Context**: 
   - Although the Prometheus URL was unreachable, Grafana and Alertmanager were resolving.
   - There seemed to be an issue preventing requests to reach the prometheus pods.
   - Disk space and other resources, the usual suspects, were ruled out as the cause.
   - The domain name amd ingress were both valid.

- **Resolution**: 
    We suspect an intermittent & external networking issue to be the cause of this outage.


### Incident on 12-02-2020 11:45 UTC

- **Status**: Resolved at 12:07 UTC

- **Identified**: Pingdom reported Concourse (concourse.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) down.

- **Context**: One of the engineers was deleting old clusters (he ran `terraform destroy`) and he wasn't fully aware in which _terraform workspace_ was working on. Using `terraform destroy`, EKS nodes/workers were deleted from the manager cluster.

- **Resolution**: Using terraform (`terraform apply -var-file vars/manager.tfvars` specifically) the cluster nodes where created and the infrastructure aligned? to the desired terraform state
