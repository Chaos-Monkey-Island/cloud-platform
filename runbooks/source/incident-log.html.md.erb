# Incident Log

## February 2020

### Incident on 12-02-2020 11:45 UTC

- **Status**: Resolved at 12:07 UTC

- **Identified**: Pingdom reported Concourse (concourse.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk) down.

- **Context**: One of the engineers was deleting old clusters (he ran `terraform destroy`) and he wasn't fully aware in which _terraform workspace_ was working on. Using `terraform destroy`, EKS nodes/workers were deleted from the manager cluster.

- **Resolution**: Using terraform (`terraform apply -var-file vars/manager.tfvars` specifically) the cluster nodes where created and the infrastructure aligned? to the desired terraform state
