# Remove data from Elasticsearch

This runbook aims to guide you through purging specific logs/data from Elasticsearch. 

Let's assume in this guide that we are trying to delete all logs of the  `my-namespace-production` namespace, from the 01/02/2020

## Things to know 

An important thing to understand is the difference between an index and a document. 
An index contains documents. In our case, documents are logs entries.

The current logging strategy is to have one index per day, containing all the daily logs.
All application logs are sent to that daily index, ex:  `logstash-2020.02.01`

Although it is possible to delete a whole index with a curator job, this guide will only cover the deletion of specific documents.

**Running `curl` queries has to be done from within the live-1 VPC.**

## Build your query

It is possible to reuse the body of a `search` query for a `delete` query.

Therefore, if we narrow down a search query to exactly what we want to delete, we've done most of the work.

Kibana offers a webconsole to test queries, head over to:  
http://KIBANA-URL/_plugin/kibana/app/kibana#/dev_tools/console?_g=()


A standard query is : 
```
GET /logstash-2020.02.01/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "kubernetes.namespace_name.keyword": "my-namespace-production"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important note: `.keyword` force elasticsearch to only return exact matches. Without it, you may end up deleting more than you wish**
  


As a `curl` command, the query above would translate as: 
```console
curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/logstash-2020.02.01/_search" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "kubernetes.namespace_name.keyword": "my-namespace-production"
    }
  }
}'
```

Once the result of the search query fit what you want to delete exactly, carry on to the next step.

## Delete by query

To delete documents, we will use a `POST` request against the `delete_by_query` endpoint. 


    curl -XPOST \
        https://ELASTICESEARCH URL/logstash-2020.02.01/_delete_by_query?pretty \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d'{"query":{"match":{"kubernetes.namespace_name.keyword.keyword": "my-namespace-production"}}}'
