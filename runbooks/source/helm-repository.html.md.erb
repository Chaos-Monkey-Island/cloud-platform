# Cloud Platform helm chart repository

The cloud-platform team uses Github pages as helm chart repository. The main advantage is directly related to maintainability: we don't need to keep an eye ay service, just in source code.

The [github repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helm-charts) has more details about the it.

## Workflow to update helm charts

### 1. Make the change

The first step is branching from from master and make the desired changes. Before test the change and make sure everyone is happy with **don't forget** to increment the chart's _version_ field inside `Chart.yaml`.

Test 

### 2. Create the tarball

Now we should create the artefact containing our helm chart. Using `helm package` command:

```
$ helm package fluentd-es/
Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: /Users/mogaal/workspace/github/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-helm-charts/fluentd-es-2.7.0.tgz
$ file fluentd-es-2.7.0.tgz
fluentd-es-2.7.0.tgz: gzip compressed data, extra field, has comment, original size modulo 2^32 47104
```

*NOTE*: Also include the the tarball/artifact in the PR. 

### 3. Generate `index.yaml`

The last step consists of regenerate the `index.yaml` which track all artefact within the repository:

```
$ helm repo index --url  https://ministryofjustice.github.io/cloud-platform-helm-charts/ --merge index.yaml .
$
```

(yes, no output but the `index.yaml` should've been modified)

### 4. Commit and create the PR

The last step is to commit and create the PR, once it gets approved and merged it will take some minutes to appear in the repo.
