# Manually Delete Namespace Resources

We have a [script][deleter script] which will delete all of the AWS resources belonging to a given namespace, by running `terraform apply` with an empty `main.tf` file, and then running `kubectl delete namespace`.

> The script will not do anything if:
>
> a) the namespace folder exists in your local working copy of the [environments repository], or
>
> b) the namespace has `is-production: "true"`

NB: You need `ruby` installed, in order to use this tool.

To run the script:

1. populate the environment variables listed in the comment at the top of the script

1. cd to the root of a working copy of the [environments repository]

1. Run `bundle install`

1. Run the script, supplying the namespace name as the only argument, e.g.

```
./bin/delete-namespace.rb mynamespace
```
