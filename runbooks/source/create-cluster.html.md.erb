# Create a new cluster

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, there are a few pre-requisites:

- Your GPG key must be added to the [infrastructure repo] so that you are able to run `git-crypt unlock` (the script will run this for you, but you must be *able* to do it)

- You must ensure your local [helm] version is => `2.11` (check by running `helm version`)

- You must have the terraform auth0 provider installed. It isn't listed in the official Terraform repository so follow [the instructions][auth0 provider instructions] to install it.

- You have [kops] installed

- You have the [AWS CLI] tool installed, and profiles `moj-cp` and `moj-dsd` with suitable credentials

## Environment Variables

See the file `example.env.create-cluster` in the [infrastructure repo]. This shows examples of the environment variables which must be set in order to run the `create-cluster.sh` script to create a new cluster.

You can get the auth0 values from the `terraform-provider-auth0` application on [auth0](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications).

## Run the build script

> WARNING: Be aware that this script uses the kubernetes context defined on **your machine**, when applying the `cloud-platform-components` terraform files. So, if you have started this script and then used a different terminal to do some other work, it is very easy to forget about the build script and switch your kubernetes context to point to the live cluster. **This can break parts of the production environment.**

Start from the root directory of a working copy of the [infrastructure repo].

Execute the script, supplying the desired name of your new cluster. e.g.:

```bash
./create-cluster.sh david-test1
```

NB: Your cluster name must be **no more than 12 characters**. Any longer, and some of the computed strings which include the cluster name will exceed their maximum allowed values. The error messages you get if this happens are unhelpful. In order to prevent this, the build script will fail immediately if you supply a name which is too long.

See our [cluster naming policy] for information on how to choose a suitable name for your cluster.

The script takes around 30 minutes to execute. At the end, you should see output like this:

```
Kubernetes master is running at https://api.david-test1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
KubeDNS is running at https://api.david-test1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```
