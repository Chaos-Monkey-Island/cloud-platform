# AWS Compromised Credentials 

## Steps for a leaked credentials

1) Login into our AWS Management Console

2) Go to **Services -> IAM** and search for the user with credentials leaked (**TIP** You can search either by *Access Keys* or by *Username*). In case you prefer using the CLI: 

```
aws iam list-users --output json --query 'Users[?contains(UserName, `testAlejandro`)  == `true`]'
```

3) Within the User, click "Delete user" button in the top right corner. In case you prefer using the CLI you'll have to delete dependences (Access Keys, Groups, etc) first, an example can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/kgmoore431/886aa60cd7fdc9a43bc5c05f9e956adf).

4) Notify the user about what happened in Slack
