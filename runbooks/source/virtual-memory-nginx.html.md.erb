# Failed to allocate shared memory

Due to the amount of ingresses `live-1` is managining, we are facing shared memory issues with nginx ingress controller. Even though we [applied some remediations](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-ingress-controller/pull/3/files), every second week we still face the same problem

```

Partial solution for this is to delete/recycle all pods within `ingress-controllers` namespace. You can do it in groups of 3 as below:

```
$ kubectl -n ingress-controllers delete pod nginx-ingress-acme-controller-XXXXXXX nginx-ingress-acme-controller-YYYYY nginx-ingress-acme-controller-ZZZZZ
```

Wait until the new ones get spin up and carry on with the other 3 pods remaining
