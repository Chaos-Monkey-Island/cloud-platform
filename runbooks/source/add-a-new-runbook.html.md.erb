# Add a new runbook

#### 1. `git pull` to get the latest changes
#### 2. Create a feature branch for your new runbook
#### 3. Run `make server` to start a development webserver to view your changes
#### 4. Add your runbook as a new file in the [source] directory

* Your filename must match `*.html.md.erb`
* Your file must have a header section like this

```

title: Add a new runbook
weight: 9999

```

- The `weight` value controls ordering in the table of contents
- Use `position * 100` to leave enough room for new runbooks
- Do not put leading zeroes on the `weight` value, they won't work
* Your content **must** start with a markdown heading one line, e.g.

```
# Add a new runbook
```
#### 5. Push your feature branch and raise a PR
#### 6. Merge your PR and delete your feature branch

CircleCI will compile and deploy a new version of the runbooks guide, with your changes.
