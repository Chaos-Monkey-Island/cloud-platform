# AWS Console Access

New joiners for Cloud platform team will need AWS Console access for most things. IAM resources (users, groups, roles, etc) are managed by terraform so new users are nothing more than new resources **in terraform**.

 - [terraform-aws-iam module](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-iam)

## Steps to create/delete users

1) Create a git branch and add (or delete) the user as [terraform code](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure/blob/master/terraform/global-resources/iam/main.tf). Do not forget to link the user to a group.

2) Using `terraform plan` verify you're happy with the terraform changes.

3) Create the PR and ask the team to review it.

4) Once PR gets merged you must proceed to execute `terraform apply` and verify user (you can use AWS Console for this). 

## Activating MFA for new users

Unfortunataly terraform can't activate MFA for users, this process must be done done manually either [thorugh AWS Console (UI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html) or [throgh the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_cliapi.html).
